Example of Normalization
Suppose you have a table called Orders that looks like this:

OrderID	CustomerName	Product1	Product2	Product3	TotalAmount
1	Alice	WidgetA	WidgetB	WidgetC	100
2	Bob	WidgetD	WidgetE	NULL	50
This table is not normalized because it includes repeating groups (Product1, Product2, Product3) and contains redundant
information.

Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
Ensure that the table contains only atomic values.

OrderID	CustomerName	Product	TotalAmount
1	Alice	WidgetA	100
1	Alice	WidgetB	100
1	Alice	WidgetC	100
2	Bob	WidgetD	50
2	Bob	WidgetE	50
Now each column contains only one piece of information per row.

Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
Remove partial dependencies by moving data to related tables.

Create a Customers table:

CustomerID	CustomerName
1	Alice
2	Bob
Create an Orders table:

OrderID	CustomerID	TotalAmount
1	1	100
2	2	50
Create an OrderDetails table to store each product:

OrderID	Product
1	WidgetA
1	WidgetB
1	WidgetC
2	WidgetD
2	WidgetE
Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
Ensure that all columns are dependent on the primary key.

In our example, the tables are already in 3NF because all non-key attributes (like CustomerName in the Customers table)
are dependent on the primary key.

Implementing Related Tables in SQLite
To implement normalized tables with related data in SQLite, you can follow these steps:

Create Tables:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INTEGER,
    TotalAmount REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
    OrderDetailID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderID INTEGER,
    Product TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID)
);
Insert Data:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');

INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, 100), (2, 50);

INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderID, Product) VALUES
    (1, 'WidgetA'),
    (1, 'WidgetB'),
    (1, 'WidgetC'),
    (2, 'WidgetD'),
    (2, 'WidgetE');
Querying Data:

To retrieve data, you can use JOIN to combine information from multiple tables.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, OrderDetails.Product, Orders.TotalAmount
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
This query will return the customer name, order ID, product, and total amount for each order item.

Benefits of Normalization
Data Integrity: Ensures consistency and accuracy of the data.
Reduction of Redundancy: Minimizes duplicate data, reducing storage requirements.
Easier Maintenance: Simplifies updates, inserts, and deletions.
Scalability: A well-normalized database can handle growing amounts of data more efficiently.
However, it's important to balance normalization with performance needs. In some cases, denormalization (the opposite
of normalization) might be considered for optimizing read-heavy applications, but that should be done carefully.
