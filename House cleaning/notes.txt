o connect your new_account objects with transaction objects, a good approach would be to establish a relationship between them. Here’s a possible solution:

Suggestions:
Add a transactions attribute to the new_account class:

The new_account class can have a list or dictionary that stores Transaction objects.
Each time a transaction occurs, you create a Transaction object and append it to the account's transaction list.
Pass Account Reference to Transaction:

When a transaction is created, pass the account as a parameter so that each transaction is tied to its respective account.
Database Relationship:

Once you implement a database, you can use foreign key relationships to link the two tables (Accounts and Transactions).
Example of Object-Oriented Link:
python
Copy code
class Account:
    def __init__(self, holder_name):
        self.holder_name = holder_name
        self.balance = {'Checking': 0, 'Savings': 0}
        self.transactions = []  # Store transactions for the account

    def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        self.transactions.append(transaction)

class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, account, transaction_type, amount):
        self.account = account  # Link to account object
        self.transaction_type = transaction_type
        self.amount = amount

        # Automatically update the account's balance
        if transaction_type == 'Deposit':
            account.balance['Checking'] += amount
        elif transaction_type == 'Withdrawal':
            account.balance['Checking'] -= amount

        # Record the transaction in the account's transaction list
        account.add_transaction(self)

# Example usage
account = Account('John Doe')
transaction1 = Transaction(account, 'Deposit', 500)
transaction2 = Transaction(account, 'Withdrawal', 200)

# Account's transactions are now linked to the account object
print(account.transactions)  # Shows the transaction history
How This Helps:
Every account object has a list of transactions associated with it, so when you export data to a database, you can simply access the transaction list for that account.
You can easily extend this structure to work with databases, where each Transaction can reference an Account object via a foreign key.




   Looks like you can use sqlite3 and have normalized databases with reference tables. this should work for accounts,
   transaction logging, and account details.
    Start thinking about how you want to structure your data. This is will important later.

Your going to need a random number generator for customer ID's. and then make sure that you dont have duplicates.

    -MarketWatch
        - Add utilities to look at current market state. can use indexes. possible start having a saved list* of stocks.
        - add portfolio management. Will need to use selenium to log into profiles and pull data from page.
